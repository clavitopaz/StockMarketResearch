# Gauging outperformance of tickers by industry
Clustering to segment stocks by industries. 
- stock percentage & actual movement in a day, week, month
- NI in previous 4 quarters, dividend pmts,

# September 2023 - looking ahead
## Target
- Compare Target to Wal-Mart, Costco, Best Buy, Cons Disc Index, Lowe's/HD. 
## Ann Bausch? (Bud Light)
- Compare to (other beer tickers?), KO. 
## CPI
- Is CPI YoY% decrease stopping? Is MoM % going higher than current rate? 
## Federal Reserve rate increases
- If nothing breaks, rates will go higher. If it resumes, it may have a negative impact to long-term maturity holders, leases/loans. Positive for highly positive cash flow companies (QoQ, cash-rich in general). 
- Cluster companies with high long-term bond balances and sort by lowest revenue gain QoQ, then highest expense gain QoQ.
## Recession
- Anomaly - how would tickers react to announcements of layoffs? How many in succession one would see, and what would spark it? (Further rate hikes, to tech, finance companies - not labor/service companies (unless, consumer spending starts going down))
